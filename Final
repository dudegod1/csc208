Exercise 1 What is the smallest number of colors you need to properly color the vertices of K4,5​? That is, find the chromatic number of the graph.
Solution: K4,5 is a complete bipartite graph. In a complete bipartite graph Km,n the chromatic number is 2, since you can color all vertices in one set with one color and all vertices in the other set with a different color. Thus, the chromatic number of K4,5​ is 2.

Exercise 2 	
Question: Draw a graph with chromatic number 6 (i.e., which requires 6 colors to properly color the vertices). Could your graph be planar? Explain.
Solution:
Graph with Chromatic Number 6: A common example of a graph with a chromatic number of 6 is the complete graph K6.
Planarity Check using the Four Color Theorem: The Four Color Theorem states that any planar graph can be colored with at most 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
Since the Four Color Theorem limits the chromatic number of any planar graph to at most 4, a graph that requires 6 colors to properly color its vertices cannot be planar. Therefore, K6 is not planar, as it exceeds the 4-color limit set by the Four Color Theorem.
