## Exercise 1

**Question:** What is the smallest number of colors you need to properly color the vertices of \( K_{4,5} \)? That is, find the chromatic number of the graph.

**Solution:** \( K_{4,5} \) is a complete bipartite graph. In a complete bipartite graph \( K_{m,n} \), the chromatic number is 2, since you can color all vertices in one set with one color and all vertices in the other set with a different color. Thus, the chromatic number of \( K_{4,5} \) is 2.

## Exercise 2

**Question:** Draw a graph with chromatic number 6 (i.e., which requires 6 colors to properly color the vertices). Could your graph be planar? Explain.

**Solution:**

1. **Graph with Chromatic Number 6:** A common example of a graph with a chromatic number of 6 is the complete graph \( K_6 \).

2. **Planarity Check using the Four Color Theorem:** The Four Color Theorem states that any planar graph can be colored with at most 4 colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

Since the Four Color Theorem limits the chromatic number of any planar graph to at most 4, a graph that requires 6 colors to properly color its vertices cannot be planar. Therefore, \( K_6 \) is not planar, as it exceeds the 4-color limit set by the Four Color Theorem.
