# Permutations and Combinations!

### Permations are the possible rearrangements of objects:

### Imagine having *a, b, and c* --> We know that are 6 combinations because of $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

### So to find the permutation if you have a certain number of elements, just take the factorial of that number!

### To find the k-permutations of n elements:
$P(6,4) = 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 = 360$
$P(n, k) = n! \div (n-k)!
