What are Mathematical Statements?
  Definition: A declarative sentence that is either true or false
  Types: Atomic (indivisble) and Molecular (composed of small statements)
  Example: Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes (Atomic)

Locial Connectives:
  Definition: Tools to build molecular statements from atomic or smaller molecular ones
  List and Explain: And, Or, If-then, Not
  Example: Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square (Molecular)

Implications in Mathematics:
  Definition: A statement of the form-if P then Q
  Key Concept: True if the hypothesis is false or the conclusion is true
  Example: If a number is even, then it is divisible by 2

  Proving Implications:
    Method: Direct Proof
    Explanation: Assume hypothesis is true and deduce the conclusion
    Example: Proving-if two numbers are even, then their sum is even

  Converse and Contrapositive:
    Definition: Converse- is not equivalent to the original-------- Contrapositive-IS equivalent to the original
    Example: Original: If it rains, the ground is wet -- Converse: If the ground is wet, it rains -- Contrapositive: If the ground is not wet, it did not rain
